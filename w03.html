    <ul>
    <li>
      The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep]
    </li>
    <li>
    A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding]
    </li>
    <p>
      Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
