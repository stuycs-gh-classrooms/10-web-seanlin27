<h2>Petals</h2>
    <p>Petals are used by the flower to defend itself. They are obtained by killing mobs. Petals come in 8 different rarities: common, unusual, rare, epic, 
        legendary, mythic, ultra, and super. The higher the rarity of the petal, the stronger it is. Some petals gain new properties at a certain rarity. Most petals 
        have health and petal damage like flowers, but also a petal reload. Petals can also be absorbed for experience, which then translates into levels.</p>
    <p>5 petals of the same rarity can be crafted for a chance to create 1 petal of the next rarity. If the crafting fails, 1-4 petals are destroyed. 
        The higher the rarity, the smaller the chance of success. This is arguably the most demoralizing aspect of the game.</p>
    <p>Petals can do a wide variety of things, which include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul> <li>Deal damage to mobs</li>
         <li>Heal the flower</li>
         <li>Summon friendly mobs to defend the flower</li>
         <li>Increase flower speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal rotation speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal range</li>
         <li>Push back mobs</li>
         <li>Revive dead flowers</li>
         <li>Absolutely nothing</li></ul>
