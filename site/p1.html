    <h2>Petals</h2>
    <p>Petals are used by the flower to defend itself. They are obtained by killing mobs. Petals come in 8 different rarities; the higher the rarity, the stronger the petal. Similar to flowers, they have health and petal damage, but also a petal reload. Petals can also be absorbed for experience, which then translates into levels.</p>
    <p>5 petals of the same rarity can be crafted for a chance to create 1 petal of the next rarity. If the crafting fails, 1-4 petals are destroyed. The higher the rarity, the smaller the chance of success. This is arguably the most demoralizing aspect of the game.</p>
    <p>Petals can do a wide variety of things, which include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul> <li>Deal damage to mobs</li>
         <li>Heal the flower</li>
         <li>Summon friendly mobs to defend the flower</li>
         <li>Increase flower speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal rotation speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal range</li>
         <li>Push back mobs</li>
         <li>Revive dead flowers</li>
         <li>Absolutely nothing</li></ul>
