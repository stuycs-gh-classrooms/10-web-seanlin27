<h2>Flowers</h2>
    <p>Flowers are the form players take in-game. Flowers have health and body damage(damage dealt on collision) which increase with their level. 
        Flowers can obtain "talents" that can further increase its stats using talent points that they get every time they level up. 
        Flowers also have an inventory in which they can equip petals.</p>
    <p>Flowers have 3 modes:</p>
    <ol> <li>Neutral, the default mode where the flower doesn't do much</li> 
         <li>Attacking, where the flower extends its petals outward</li>
         <li>Defending, where the flower retracts its petals to protect itself</li></ol>
