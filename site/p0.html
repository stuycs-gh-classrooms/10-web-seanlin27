<h2>Flowers</h2>
    <p>Flowers(or "florr"s) are the form players take in-game. Flowers have health and body damage(damage dealt on collision) which increase with their level. Flowers have a 
        "gallery" that keeps track of all the different mobs they've defeated and their stats. Flowers can obtain "talents" that can further increase its stats using 
        talent points that they get every time they level up. 
        Flowers have an inventory in which they store petals. The petals the flower actually uses are placed in the loadout. The loadout can contain 5 petals at once,
        but this can be increased through talents.</p>
    <p>Besides loadout, the various talents include:
    <ul> <li>Luck(the likelyhood of encountering rarer mobs)</li>
         <li>Crafting(the ability to craft higher rarity petals)</li>
         <li>Talented Crafting(increasing the chances of crafting success)</li>
         <li>Health(increasing health)</li>
         <li>Medic(increasing healing)</li>
         <li>Sharp Edges(increasing body damage)</li>
         </ul></p>
    <p>Flowers have 3 modes:</p>
    <ol> <li>Neutral, the default mode where the flower doesn't do much</li> 
         <li>Attacking, where the flower extends its petals outward(pressing LMB or SPACE)</li>
         <li>Defending, where the flower retracts its petals to protect itself(pressing RMB or SHIFT)</li></ol>
