<h2>Mobs</h2>
    <p>Mobs are enemies that attack flowers. Mobs are based off of insects and plants in real life. Like petals, they come in 8 rarites and get stronger 
        the higher the rarity. Like flowers, they have health and body damage, but many also have additional stats for their abilities.</p>
    <p>Mobs use the three generic behavior patterns:</p>
    <ol> <li>Passive, where the mob just walks around and doesn't do much</li>
         <li>Neutral, where the mob is passive until it is hit, whereupon it then becomes aggressive</li>
         <li>Aggressive, where the mob chases the closest flower in a certain range</li></ol>
    <p>Different mobs have different abilities they can use, which include:</p>
    <ul> <li>Shooting projectiles at the flower</li>
         <li>Running away</li>
         <li>Disable petals for a period of time</li>
         <li>Spawn additional mobs</li>
         <li>Occasionally charge toward the player at high speeds</li>
         <li>Deal poison damage</li>
         <li>Drop traps for the player as they move</li>
         <li>And much more!</li></ul>
