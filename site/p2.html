<h2>Mobs</h2>
    <p>Mobs are enemies that attack flowers. Most are based off of insects and plants in real life. Like flowers, they have health and body damage, but some also 
        have additional stats for their abilities. They come in the same 8 rarites as petals and get stronger the higher the rarity. Any mob at the Ultra or Super 
        rarity are considered bosses. The spawning of an Ultra will be broadcast to everyone in the same room, and the spawning of a Super will be broadcast 
        to everyone in the server. Recalling the fact that there is a petal that can revive flowers, it's not hard to guess the most common chat message during a 
        Super fight. </p>
    <p> Mobs may also gain abilities at certain rarites. A spider at the Mythic rarity or higher will lay webs as it walks, and a shell at Ultra rarity or higher 
        may occasionally shoot out pearls.</p>
    <p>Mobs use the three generic behavior patterns:
    <ol> <li>Passive, where the mob just walks around and doesn't do much</li>
         <li>Neutral, where the mob is passive until it is hit, whereupon it then becomes aggressive</li>
         <li>Aggressive, where the mob chases the closest flower in a certain range</li></ol></p>
    <p>Different mobs have different abilities they can use, which include:
    <ul> <li>Shooting projectiles at the flower</li>
         <li>Running away</li>
         <li>Disable petals for a period of time</li>
         <li>Spawn additional mobs</li>
         <li>Occasionally charge toward the player at high speeds</li>
         <li>Deal poison damage</li>
         <li>Drop traps for the player as they move</li>
         <li>And much more!</li></ul></p>
