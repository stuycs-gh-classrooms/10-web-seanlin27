    <h2>Flowers</h2>
    <p>Flowers are the form players take in-game. Flowers have health and body damage(damage dealt on collision). Flowers also have an inventory in which they can equip petals. These petals rotate around the flower.</p>
    <p>Flowers have 3 modes:</p>
    <ol> <li>Neutral, the default mode where the flower doesn't do much</li> 
         <li>Attacking, where the flower extends its petals outward</li>
         <li>Defending, where the flower retracts its petals to protect itself</li></ol>
