    <h2>Flowers</h2>
    <p>Flowers are the form players take in-game. Flowers have health and body damage(damage dealt on collision) which increase with their level. Flowers can obtain "talents" that can further increase its stats using talent points that they get every time they level up. Flowers also have an inventory in which they can equip petals.</p>
    <p>Flowers have 3 modes:</p>
    <ol> <li>Neutral, the default mode where the flower doesn't do much</li> 
         <li>Attacking, where the flower extends its petals outward</li>
         <li>Defending, where the flower retracts its petals to protect itself</li></ol>

    <h2>Petals</h2>
    <p>Petals are used by the flower to defend itself. They are obtained by killing mobs. Petals come in 8 different rarities; the higher the rarity, the stronger the petal. Similar to flowers, they have health and petal damage, but also a petal reload. Petals can also be absorbed for experience, which then translates into levels.</p>
    <p>5 petals of the same rarity can be crafted for a chance to create 1 petal of the next rarity. If the crafting fails, 1-4 petals are destroyed. The higher the rarity, the smaller the chance of success. This is arguably the most demoralizing aspect of the game.</p>
    <p>Petals can do a wide variety of things, which include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul> <li>Deal damage to mobs</li>
         <li>Heal the flower</li>
         <li>Summon friendly mobs to defend the flower</li>
         <li>Increase flower speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal rotation speed</li>
         <li>Increase petal range</li>
         <li>Push back mobs</li>
         <li>Revive dead flowers</li>
         <li>Absolutely nothing</li></ul>

    <h2>Mobs</h2>
    <p>Mobs are enemies that attack flowers. Mobs are based off of insects and plants in real life. Like petals, they come in 8 rarites and get stronger the higher the rarity. Like flowers, they have health and body damage, but many also have additional stats for their abilities.</p>
    <p>Mobs use the three generic behavior patterns:</p>
    <ol> <li>Passive, where the mob just walks around and doesn't do much</li>
         <li>Neutral, where the mob is passive until it is hit, whereupon it then becomes aggressive</li>
         <li>Aggressive, where the mob chases the closest flower in a certain range</li></ol>
    <p>Different mobs have different abilities they can use, which include:</p>
    <ul> <li>Shooting projectiles at the flower</li>
         <li>Running away</li>
         <li>Disable petals for a period of time</li>
         <li>Spawn additional mobs</li>
         <li>Occasionally charge toward the player at high speeds</li>
         <li>Deal poison damage</li>
         <li>Drop traps for the player as they move</li>
         <li>And much more!</li></ul>
