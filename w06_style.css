      The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.

    <ul>
    <li>
      The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep]
    </li>
    <li>
    A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding]
    </li>
    <p>
      Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
